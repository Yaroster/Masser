Welcome to Masser, the spiritual successor of the cherished Turkraft server, now reimagined for Minecraft version 1.20.*. Masser is where the legacy of Turkraft, popular from 2012 to 2014, is reborn with a modern twist. Here, we offer the source code of our updated Bukkit plugin and a redesigned website, both drawing inspiration from the original Turkraft server. While the unique features of the original Minecraft client and launcher are not included, Masser aims to recapture the essence of its predecessor.

Join us as we revisit the glory days of Turkraft in a new era, inviting both old and new players to experience the evolution of our community.

This project is still in very early developpment stages ! But we are excited to show our advancement as we progress towards release.
