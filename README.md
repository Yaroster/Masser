# Turkraft

Here you'll find the source code of the Bukkit plugin and the website built for the Turkraft (Minecraft) community back in 2012-2014. The Minecraft game client and launcher were decompiled and unique features were also added back then, but that's not available here. Everything was built from scratch and there isn't any dependency.

There were 200+ registered players before shutting down everything, and the legend says that they couldn't find a better server to this date.
